# ate.sh

`ate.sh` records what you ate and when. Just symlink it somewhere in your `PATH` (`/user/local/bin` perhaps) as `ate` and you can keep a food log: `ate two pounds of cake`, `ate one small child`, etc.

Food entries will show up in `~/ate.md` like so:
```
2018-05-12 10:31 AM | two pounds of cake
2018-05-12 03:52 PM | one small child
```
